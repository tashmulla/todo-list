# 🎉 Todo List

Welcome to my Todo List project! This project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Frontend**: The user interface of the application, built with modern web technologies. 🌐
2. **Backend**: The server-side logic and database management. 🗄️

## Project Structure 📂

- `todo-frontend/`: Contains the frontend code. 💻
- `todo-backend/`: Contains the backend code. 🖥️

## Getting Started 🚀

### Running the full-stack app with docker-compose

From the root directory of the project, `todo-list`, ensure you have Docker running and then run the following to start up both the backend & frontend services:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

### Running each service separately

To run each service separately, follow the local development instructions in the respective `README.md` files located in the `todo-frontend` and `todo-backend` directories.

Happy coding and todo list making! 🎨✨
